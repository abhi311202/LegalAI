                In the legal sector, handling large volumes of documents is a
                routine but essential task. Legal practitioners, researchers,
                and even clients frequently deal with extensive paperwork that
                demands careful review and analysis. However, this manual
                process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and can lead to
                inefficiencies within the legal workflow. Our solution aims to
                address these challenges through the power of Artificial
                Intelligence and MachineÂ Learning.
